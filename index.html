    <h1>Monte Carlo Simulation To Estimate Pi</h1>
    <p>
        Monte Carlo methods, or simulations, are a broad class of computational
        algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.
        <br><br>
        One method to estimate the value of π (3.141592…) is by using a Monte Carlo method.
        This methods consists of drawing a square with an inner circle. Then
        counting how many fall in the enclosed circle.
        <br><br>
        The area of the circle is 𝐴 = 𝜋𝑟<sup>2</sup>
        <br><br>
        The area of the square is 𝐴 = 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡h<sup>2</sup> = (2𝑟)<sup>2</sup>
        <br><br>
        If we divide the area of the circle, by the area of the square we get π/4.
        The same ratio can be used between the number of points within the square and
        the circle
        <br><br>
        Hence we can use the following formula to estimate Pi:
        <br><br>
        π ≈ 4 x (number of points in the circle / total number of points)
